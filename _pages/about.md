I am a Ph.D. student at Cornell University, advised by Prof. [Kevin Ellis](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ellisk/). I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

My research interest lies in the generalizability of AI models, in particular, generalizing/adapting to out-of-distribution samples (e.g., inputs of larger scales, unseen combinations, and new concepts/domains). I currently focus on neuro-symbolic program synthesis to integrate neural networks with programmatic prior for better generalizability and interpretability. It involves fields such as program synthesis, latent abstraction learning, and learning to optimize.
