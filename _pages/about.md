I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in Comptuer Science at Cornell University, advised by [Prof. Kevin Ellis](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ellisk/). Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor and master degrees from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

My research interest lies in generalizable powerful AI, with a focus on neuro-symbolic program synthesis which integrates programmatic modules/architecture/prior and neural networks to achieve better generalizability and interpretabiilty. It involves many subfieds that I am excited about, such as abstraction & symbol grounding, learning to learn (or amortized inference, neural heuristics), and generally joint optimization of discrete and continuous parameters.
